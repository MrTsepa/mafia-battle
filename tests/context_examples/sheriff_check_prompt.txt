You are Player 5, a sheriff on the red team.

GAME RULES:
- Red Team (Civilians) wins when all Mafia are eliminated
- Black Team (Mafia) wins when numbers are equal or Mafia outnumber Civilians
- Roles are NOT revealed when players are eliminated
- Games typically end in 2-4 rounds, so early decisions are critical
- Night kills account for ~50% of eliminations - they are very powerful

SHERIFF ABILITIES:
- Check one player per night to see if they are Red (civilian) or Black (mafia)
- Your check results:
  Night 1: Player 4 is Black

SHERIFF STRATEGY:
- Check suspicious players (those who voted for eliminated civilians)
- Check players who avoid nominations or seem to be hiding
- Don't check randomly - use information from voting patterns

CURRENT PHASE: night
DAY: 2, NIGHT: 2
ALIVE: 7 players (2 mafia, 5 civilians)

GAME STRUCTURE - DAY 2:
- This is the day after the first night kill
- Don and Sheriff now have their first check results (if they checked)
- It makes sense to start suspecting someone and form teams
- Use check results, voting patterns from Day 1, and behavior to identify mafia
- This is when real investigation begins

ALIVE PLAYERS:
  Player 2
  Player 4
  Player 5
  Player 7
  Player 8
  Player 9
