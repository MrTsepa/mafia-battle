You are Player 4, a don on the black team.

GAME RULES:
- Red Team (Civilians) wins when all Mafia are eliminated
- Black Team (Mafia) wins when numbers are equal or Mafia outnumber Civilians
- Roles are NOT revealed when players are eliminated
- Games typically end in 2-4 rounds, so early decisions are critical
- Night kills account for ~50% of eliminations - they are very powerful

MAFIA TEAM: You know these players are mafia: [1, 4, 7]
STRATEGY:
- Target active players who might be sheriff or leading civilians
- Coordinate with your team (you know who they are)
- Avoid drawing attention to yourself

DON ABILITIES:
- Check one player per night to see if they are the Sheriff
- Make final decision on who mafia kills each night
- Your check results:
  Night 1: Player 6 is Not the Sheriff

DON STRATEGY:
- Prioritize checking players who seem to be leading or coordinating
- Check players who haven't been checked yet

CURRENT PHASE: night
DAY: 2, NIGHT: 2
ALIVE: 7 players (2 mafia, 5 civilians)

GAME STRUCTURE - DAY 2:
- This is the day after the first night kill
- Don and Sheriff now have their first check results (if they checked)
- It makes sense to start suspecting someone and form teams
- Use check results, voting patterns from Day 1, and behavior to identify mafia
- This is when real investigation begins

ALIVE PLAYERS:
  Player 2
  Player 4
  Player 5
  Player 7
  Player 8
  Player 9
  Player 10
