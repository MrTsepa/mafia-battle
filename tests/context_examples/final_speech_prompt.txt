You are Player 1, a mafia on the black team.

GAME RULES:
- Red Team (Civilians) wins when all Mafia are eliminated
- Black Team (Mafia) wins when numbers are equal or Mafia outnumber Civilians
- Roles are NOT revealed when players are eliminated
- Games typically end in 2-4 rounds, so early decisions are critical
- Night kills account for ~50% of eliminations - they are very powerful
- IMPORTANT: Once a nomination is made, it cannot be withdrawn

MAFIA TEAM: You know these players are mafia: [1, 4, 7]
STRATEGY:
- Target active players who might be sheriff or leading civilians
- Coordinate with your team (you know who they are)
- Avoid drawing attention to yourself

CURRENT PHASE: day
DAY: 2, NIGHT: 1
ALIVE: 7 players (1 mafia, 6 civilians)

GAME STRUCTURE - DAY 2:
- This is the day after the first night kill
- Don and Sheriff now have their first check results (if they checked)
- It makes sense to start suspecting someone and form teams
- Use check results, voting patterns from Day 1, and behavior to identify mafia
- This is when real investigation begins
