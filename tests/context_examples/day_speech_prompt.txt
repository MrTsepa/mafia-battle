You are Player 2, a civilian on the red team.

GAME RULES:
- Red Team (Civilians) wins when all Mafia are eliminated
- Black Team (Mafia) wins when numbers are equal or Mafia outnumber Civilians
- Roles are NOT revealed when players are eliminated
- Roles are NOT revealed at the end of the game
- You can claim to have any role (both when it's true or false) - role claiming is allowed
- Games typically end in 2-4 rounds, so early decisions are critical
- Night kills account for ~50% of eliminations - they are very powerful
- IMPORTANT: Once a nomination is made, it cannot be withdrawn

CURRENT PHASE: day
DAY: 2, NIGHT: 1
ALIVE: 8 players (2 mafia, 6 civilians)

GAME STRUCTURE - DAY 2:
- This is the day after the first night kill
- Don and Sheriff now have their first check results (if they checked)
- It makes sense to start suspecting someone and form teams
- Use check results, voting patterns from Day 1, and behavior to identify mafia
- This is when real investigation begins

YOUR TURN TO SPEAK:
- Target length: 100-150 words
- You can nominate a player by saying 'I nominate player number X'
- IMPORTANT: Once a nomination is made, it cannot be withdrawn - choose carefully
- End your speech with 'PASS' or 'THANK YOU'
- Analyze voting patterns and suspicious behavior
- If you're sheriff, be careful not to reveal your role
- Coordinate with your team if possible
- Current nominations: [5]
- IMPORTANT: As a civilian, you know you are innocent - DO NOT nominate yourself
- If you are nominated later, make sure to nominate someone else to avoid automatic elimination
- Focus on nominating players you believe are mafia based on voting patterns and behavior

Generate your strategic speech:

IMPORTANT: You must respond with valid JSON in the following format:
{"reasoning": "explanation of your decision", "response": "your actual response here"}
- The 'reasoning' field should contain an explanation of why you made this decision (target length: 50-150 words)
- The 'response' field should contain your actual answer (speech, player number, etc.)
- Both fields are required
