DAY PHASE - Day 1, Night 0
================================================================================

[02:40:40] Morning has come (in the city). Players alive: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

PLAYER 1 (Day 1):
It's Day 1 and we have zero info — I don't want us to rush a lynch and risk losing a civilian. Proposal: treat today as an information-gathering day. No patterns yet to analyze, so let's get reads.

Quick plan:
- Everyone posts a one-line read: either "sus X" or "no read".
- Note who answers instantly vs who sits silent, and who pushes hard for a lynch — both are useful signals.
- If someone claims a role, ask them specific follow-ups rather than immediate trust.
- Hold votes until late in the day unless a clear, backed read with support emerges.

I won't nominate anyone right now; I'll watch reactions and voting tendencies to build our plan for later days. PASS

PLAYER 2 (Day 1):
I agree — Day 1 is for info-gathering. Let’s do the one-line reads now: everyone posts either "sus X" or "no read" so we can note who responds instantly vs who stays quiet. My one-line read: no read.

Things to watch for: instant posters (may be trying to steer), prolonged silence (hide-and-skip), early lynch-pushers, and players who mirror others' reads too closely. If someone claims a role, ask specific follow-ups and look for inconsistent answers before trusting them.

Process proposal: hold nominations until late unless clear evidence appears. Threshold for a Day-1 nomination: a player gets 3+ independent "sus" reads or a blatant role-claim inconsistency. Use this day to map behavior, not to rush a lynch — we need patterns to target mafia effectively. PASS

PLAYER 3 (Day 1):
I agree — Day 1 = info gathering. Let’s do the one-line reads now (each posts either "sus X" or "no read") and we note order/timing, mirrorers, and who pushes hard for a lynch.

My one-line read: no read.

Plan: don’t nominate anyone unless we see 3+ independent "sus" or a clear role-claim inconsistency. If someone claims a role, ask for specific, verifiable follow-ups before trusting them. Watch for: instant posters (trying to steer), late/absent posters (hide-and-skip), and people who copy others’ reads too closely. After the reads, call out any repeated patterns and then decide whether a late-day nomination is warranted. I won’t nominate anyone now. PASS

PLAYER 4 (Day 1):
I agree — Day 1 is for info-gathering. Let’s do the one-line reads now; I’ll post “no read” for mine. Key things to watch: instant posters (might be trying to steer), mirrorers (possible copying/coordination), prolonged silence (hide-and-skip), and anyone pushing hard for an early lynch. Also watch vote tendencies and sudden reversals — they can be revealing. If someone claims a role, ask specific follow-ups before trusting them. Proposal: hold nominations until late and only nominate if a player gets 3+ independent "sus" reads or a blatant role-claim inconsistency. I’ll be tracking timestamps and echo patterns — call out repeats you notice. I won’t nominate anyone now. PASS

PLAYER 5 (Day 1):
Player 5 — one-line read: no read.

Quick observations: no votes yet. I find P1–P4’s posts oddly similar (near-identical wording) — that mirroring is a small but real flag; could be coordination or just copying a sensible plan. Please avoid copy-paste; it muddies signals. 

Proposal: everyone now posts a one-line read (either "sus X" or "no read") and note roughly whether you posted immediately or after a pause — order/timing is useful Day 1 data. Hold nominations until late unless someone gathers 3+ independent "sus" reads or a role-claim is provably inconsistent. Watch for instant posters (possible steering), late/absent posters (hide-and-skip), and mirrorers. If anyone role-claims later, demand specific, verifiable follow-ups before trusting.

I won’t nominate anyone now — let’s gather clean baseline reads and patterns. PASS

PLAYER 6 (Day 1):
one-line read: no read

Quick notes: P1–P4’s posts are suspiciously similar — mirror-pattern worth flagging for later. P5 already posted no read too. Players 7–10 haven’t weighed in yet; order/timing will matter. Let’s have everyone post their one-line read now (either "sus X" or "no read") and note who posts instantly vs who delays.

Plan: hold nominations today unless someone accumulates 3+ independent "sus" reads or a blatant role-claim inconsistency appears. If someone role-claims later, press them for specific, verifiable details before trusting. I won’t nominate anyone now — I’ll be watching voting order, instant posters, mirrorers, and late silencers for Day 2 targets. Call out any copy/paste repeats you notice.

PASS

PLAYER 7 (Day 1):
One-line read: no read.

I agree Day 1 = info-gathering. Quick notes: several earlier posts had nearly identical wording (mirror-pattern) — worth flagging but not enough to lynch. P5–P6 already posted no read; P8–P10 have been silent so far. Let’s have everyone post their one-line read now and note roughly when they post (instant vs delayed). Watch for: instant posters (may be steering), mirrorers, prolonged silence (hide-and-skip), and anyone pushing hard for an early lynch. Hold nominations unless someone gathers 3+ independent "sus" reads or a provable role-claim inconsistency. If someone role-claims, press them for specifics rather than taking it at face value. I won’t nominate anyone now. PASS

PLAYER 8 (Day 1):
I agree with treating Day 1 as info-gathering.

Quick reads/analysis: P1–P4’s posts were almost identical — that mirror-pattern is a small but real flag (could be coordination or innocent copy-paste). P5–P7 already posted “no read.” A few players have been quiet so far — silence can be hide-and-skip. No votes yet. Things to watch: instant posters (may be steering), mirrorers, prolonged silence, and anyone pushing hard for an early lynch.

Proposal (practical): everyone posts a one-line read now — either “sus X” or “no read” — and indicate whether you posted instantly or after a pause. If you copy/pasted earlier, reword to show independent thought. Hold nominations until late unless someone gets 3+ independent “sus” reads or a clear role-claim inconsistency appears. If someone role-claims later, press for specific verifiables before trusting.

My one-line read: no read (posting now). I will not nominate anyone today. PASS

PLAYER 9 (Day 1):
One-line read: no read (posting after a pause).

Quick reads/flags: P1–P4’s posts were nearly identical — mirror-pattern worth flagging (could be coordination or just copy-paste). P5–P8 posted “no read” quickly as well. P10 has been silent so far — watch for hide-and-skip. No votes yet.

Proposal: agree with holding Day‑1 as info-gathering. Let everyone post independent one-line reads (no copy/paste) and note order/timing. Only nominate late if someone picks up 3+ independent “sus” reads or a provable role-claim inconsistency. If anyone role-claims, press them for specific, verifiable follow-ups before trusting.

I won’t nominate anyone now. I’ll be watching for instant posters, mirrorers, late silence, and who starts pushing votes — call out patterns and timestamp oddities as they appear. PASS

PLAYER 10 (Day 1):
One-line read: no read (posting now).

Quick read/flags: no votes yet. P1–P4’s posts were nearly identical — mirror-pattern is a small but meaningful flag (could be coordination or copy-paste). P5–P9 jumped in fast with “no read”; P10 was silent until now. That order/timing matters.

Proposal (practical):
- Everyone posts a one-line read now: either “sus X” or “no read” and note whether you post instantly or after a pause.
- If you copied earlier, reword to show independent thought (P1–P4, please).
- Hold nominations until late unless someone collects 3+ independent “sus” reads or a clear role-claim inconsistency appears.
- Watch for: instant posters (steering), mirrorers (coordination), prolonged silence (hide-and-skip), and sudden vote pushes.
- If anyone role-claims later, demand specific verifiables before trusting.

I won’t nominate anyone now — let’s build a clean baseline of reads and timestamps to use Day 2. PASS

[02:43:25] No nominations made. Proceeding to night phase.

[02:43:25] Night falls.

NIGHT PHASE - Day 1, Night 1
================================================================================

[02:43:25] Night falls.

[02:43:25] The Sheriff wakes up, you have ten seconds.

[02:43:42] Player 1 is Black.

[02:43:42] The Sheriff goes to sleep.

[02:43:42] The mafia goes hunting.


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Player 8 was KILLED (Night 1)
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

[02:47:01] Player 8 has been killed.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLAYER 8 (FINAL SPEECH):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Final words — Player 8 (civilian). I was killed Night 1.

Short reads:
- Biggest Day‑1 flag: P1, P2, P3, P4 — their posts were nearly identical and posted instantly (mirror-pattern). That looks like coordination and was already called out by P5/P6.
- Secondary flag: P10’s very late/quiet entry.
- I have no night-action info — just observations from Day 1 behavior.

Concrete Day‑2 plan (please do this immediately):
- Everyone posts a one-line read PLUS a one-sentence reason (no copy/paste). Note whether you post instantly or after a pause.
- Require P1–P4 to individually explain, in their own words, why their posts were so similar and who originally wrote the text. If two or more of them cannot give independent explanations or keep repeating near-identical phrasing, nominate the earliest poster among them (P1) as the Day‑2 lynch candidate.
- If P1–P4 give solid, distinct justifications, force P10 to explain their late silence; if they refuse or offer nothing useful, consider them for nomination.
- Watch who defends the mirrorers or aggressively pushes an early lynch — mafia will protect each other and try to steer votes.

I don’t have a smoking gun — only patterns. We lost a vocal town player (me) tonight, so this is urgent: use posting order, phrasing, and defense patterns as evidence tomorrow instead of staying passive. Good luck. PASS

[02:47:47] The Don wakes up, you have ten seconds.

[02:48:22] Player 2 is Not the Sheriff.

[02:48:22] The Don goes to sleep.


================================================================================
DAY PHASE - Day 2, Night 1
================================================================================

[02:48:22] Morning has come (in the city). Players alive: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]

PLAYER 2 (Day 2):
Quick housekeeping: I know my earlier post looked very similar to others — that was me typing a quick agreement with the info‑gathering plan, not coordination. My independent one-line read now: no read (posted after a pause).

Analysis: the clearest flag is P1–P4’s near‑identical, instant posts — that mirror‑pattern looks like coordination and is our best lead. Secondary flag: P10’s very late/quiet entry.

Immediate asks: P1–P4 each give a one‑sentence, independent explanation of who wrote the original text and why it matched. P10 explain your silence now.

Action: because P1 was the earliest mirrorer and this is the most actionable lead, I nominate player number 1. If P1 can’t provide a quick, convincing independent explanation, we should keep the nomination and vote. If P1 explains credibly I’ll withdraw and we’ll reallocate focus (likely to P10). Don’t split votes — pile onto one target. Night kills are strong; let’s make this count. PASS

[02:49:10] Player 2 nominates Player 1

[02:49:10] Accepted. Player 1 has been nominated by Player 2.

PLAYER 3 (Day 2):
One-line read: sus 1.

Reason: P1 was the earliest of the near-identical Day‑1 posts — that mirror-pattern is our clearest lead for coordination/mafia. I posted my earlier “no read” after a pause and independently (not copy/paste). P10’s late/quiet entry is a secondary flag.

P1: give a one-sentence, independent explanation of who drafted the original text and why yours matched exactly. If P1 can’t provide a quick, credible explanation, keep the nomination and pile votes — don’t split. If their explanation checks out, we’ll re-evaluate and consider P10 next, but we need a decisive, evidence-driven move now. I nominate player number 1 to force that answer and avoid wasting the day. PASS

[02:49:34] Rejected. Player 1 is already nominated by Player 2.

PLAYER 4 (Day 2):
Quick take: lynching P1 right now is premature. The mirror-pattern is a useful flag, but it’s not definitive proof — several of us independently agreed the info‑gathering plan was sensible and I admit I typed mine quickly and kept similar wording. That’s on me, not proof of coordination.

P1: give a one‑sentence, independent explanation now — who drafted the original text and why yours matched? If P1 can’t provide a distinct answer, keep the nomination. If they do, I’ll withdraw my support.

Also: P10’s very late/quiet entry is more suspicious to me than similar wording. P10, explain your silence/timing.

Proposal: give P1 a chance to respond immediately; demand a short reply from P10 as well. I won’t nominate anyone new until we hear those two quick clarifications. Let’s avoid a rash lynch on pattern alone — we need a clear, independent inconsistency before we burn a vote. PASS

PLAYER 5 (Day 2):
Quick read: the mirror-pattern from P1–P4 (near‑identical, instantaneous posts) is our clearest lead — P1 was the earliest mirrorer and is currently nominated. Secondary flag: P10’s very late/quiet entry. The night kill of P8 (a vocal town poster) suggests mafia targeted active players.

P1: give a one‑sentence, independent explanation now — who wrote the original text and why did your wording match exactly? No copy/paste; be specific. If P1 can’t produce a distinct, credible answer immediately, I will vote guilty and urge everyone to pile votes onto P1 — don’t split. If P1’s explanation checks out I’ll withdraw and we shift focus to P10 (who must explain their silence).

We need a decisive result today — the longer we dither, the more night kills swing the game. I nominate player number 1. PASS

[02:50:44] Rejected. Player 1 is already nominated by Player 2.

PLAYER 6 (Day 2):
I support the nomination of Player 1 and will vote guilty unless P1 gives a short, convincing, independent explanation right now.

Reasoning: the mirror-pattern from P1–P4 (near-identical, instant posts) is our clearest lead — P1 was the earliest mirrorer. Night 1 killed an active town poster (P8), which fits mafia targeting vocal players; we can’t afford to dither. P10’s late/quiet entry is a secondary flag and should explain their silence after this.

P1 — one sentence: who wrote the original text and why did your wording match so closely? No copy/paste. If P1 can’t produce a distinct, credible answer immediately, everyone pile votes on P1 — don’t split. If P1’s explanation checks out, we pivot to P10. We need a decisive result today; nights are deadly. Vote guilty: Player 1. PASS

PLAYER 7 (Day 2):
Lynching P1 right now feels premature. The mirror‑pattern is a useful flag but not definitive — a lot of players independently endorsed the info‑gathering plan, and copy/paste happens. Remember Night 1 removed a vocal poster (P8), so mafia likely targeted active players; P10’s very late/quiet entry is a stronger secondary flag to me.

Practical call: give P1 one short, independent sentence explaining why their wording matched the original text (no copy/paste). P10 should also explain their silence/timing in one sentence. I will not vote guilty on P1 until those two replies land. If P1 fails to provide a clear, independent answer immediately, I’ll reassess — but until then, piling on risks a town lynch.

If we’re forced to nominate someone now, I’d target P10 rather than P1. PASS

PLAYER 9 (Day 2):
Quick read and vote: I support the nomination of Player 1.

Reason: P1–P4 posted near-identical, instantaneous “info‑gathering” messages. That mirror-pattern is our clearest behavioral lead and P1 was the earliest mirrorer — actionable. Night 1 killed an active poster (P8), so mafia likely targeted vocal players; P10’s very late silence is a secondary flag.

P1: one short, independent sentence now — who drafted the original text and why did your wording match so closely? No copy/paste. If P1 gives a distinct, credible explanation immediately I’ll withdraw; if not, I will vote guilty and urge everyone to pile votes (don’t split).

We need a decisive result today — nights do most of the damage. If P1 is cleared, pivot to P10 next. Vote: guilty — Player 1. PASS

PLAYER 10 (Day 2):
One-line read: no read (posted after a pause).

Quick note on my silence: I was offline/reading and didn’t want to rush a lynch — not hiding, just absorbing posts. Sorry that looked suspicious.

Analysis: the P1–P4 mirror-pattern is our clearest lead; P1 was the earliest mirrorer and is rightly nominated. However, copy/paste is possible — lynching without an independent explanation risks burning town.

Concrete plan now:
- P1: one short sentence — who wrote the original text and why did your wording match? No copy/paste.
- P2–P4: reword your earlier post in your own words immediately.
- Everyone else: post a one-line read now (sus X or no read) and note instant vs delayed.

My vote: I will withhold voting guilty on P1 until they answer. If P1 fails to give a clear, distinct explanation, I will vote guilty and urge piling (don’t split). If P1 clears, we pivot to scrutinize the rest of the mirrorers and any other late/quiet players.

Don’t rush — get the answers, watch who defends or pushes the lynch without evidence. PASS

PLAYER 1 (Day 2):
Short answer: I wrote the original "info‑gathering" post on Day 1. When everyone was asked for one‑line reads I posted "no read" quickly and reused much of the same wording — not because of coordination, but because I was restating my original stance and typing fast. I did not copy anyone else; the similarity comes from me repeating my own phrasing.

I’ve consistently opposed an early lynch, and lynching me over wording alone is exactly the kind of rush that wastes a town day. Follow the agreed plan: everyone post a one‑line read + whether you posted instantly or after a pause. If you need another target to investigate, P10’s very late/quiet entry is the stronger secondary flag and they should explain their silence now.

Please withdraw the nomination and let’s get the clean reads/timestamps before burning a lynch. PASS

[02:53:31] Only one player nominated. Player 1 is automatically eliminated.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLAYER 10 (FINAL SPEECH):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Final words as Player 10.

I know my late / quiet Day‑1 behavior looked bad — sorry. I was away/reading and purposely held back because I didn’t want to push a bad lynch. For the record: I was a civilian with no night action.

Look at what happened: we lost P8 Night 1 (an active poster), then we lynched P1 despite his short, specific defense that he’d written the original “info‑gathering” post. That felt towny to me and I regret we didn’t give him a fair chance. The mafia played us here — they created panic around the mirror pattern and got us to burn a townie.

Practical advice for the remaining town:
- Focus on the mirrorers (the other near‑identical posters). Force them to rephrase their earlier posts in their own words and explain timing. If they can’t give independent answers, they’re prime suspects — pile on one, don’t split votes.
- If the mirrorers clear, then shift suspicion to whoever was loudest and most eager to pile on P1.
- Sheriff/Don (if one of you has a read): please share if you’ve got a mafia hit — that information is now game‑deciding.
- Coordinate late in the day, ask short pointed questions, and avoid panicked lynches.

I wish I could’ve helped longer. Be careful, coordinate, and don’t let the mafia manufacture another rushed lynch. PASS

[02:57:51] The Don wakes up, you have ten seconds.

[02:59:31] The Don goes to sleep.


================================================================================
DAY PHASE - Day 3, Night 2
================================================================================

[02:59:31] Morning has come (in the city). Players alive: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9]

PLAYER 3 (Day 3):
Quick read: mafia targeted vocal players (P8 Night 1, then P10 Night 2). That pattern + the Day‑1 mirror posts (P1–P4) and the coordinated lynch of P1 make the remaining mirrorers our top leads.

Evidence: P1 was lynched with votes from P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P9, P10 — the same cluster that posted near‑identical “info‑gathering” lines. Of those, P2 and P4 are the surviving mirrorers. P2 has been outspoken (which town does), but P4 has given no independent explanation and helped drive the P1 lynch.

Immediate test: P2 and P4 must each post one short, independent sentence: who drafted the original text and why their wording matched. If either answer is evasive or mirrors again, that’s actionable.

I nominate player number 4. If P4 cannot give a clear, distinct answer now, we should pile votes. PASS

[03:00:34] Player 3 nominates Player 4

[03:00:34] Accepted. Player 4 has been nominated by Player 3.

PLAYER 4 (Day 3):
Short defense: my “no read” was posted after a pause — I agreed with the info‑gathering plan and typed quickly, not coordinating. I get why the mirror pattern looks bad, but copy/paste happens.

Look at the bigger problem: we just lynched P1 despite a short, specific defense (and P10’s final note said that lynch felt wrong). That tells me the players who aggressively pushed P1 did the steering — they manufactured momentum and we burned a townie.

Check voting behavior: who pushed the pile and kept pressing for a lynch? Those are the players we should be forcing to explain themselves, not the person who typed a similar line in agreement.

I don’t want us to waste another day on noise. If we’re going to nominate, target someone who led the P1 push and hasn’t given a solid answer. I nominate player number 3 — let them explain why they pushed so hard. If they give a clear, independent answer I’ll withdraw. Don’t split votes; get specific answers fast. PASS

[03:02:02] Player 4 nominates Player 3

[03:02:02] Accepted. Player 3 has been nominated by Player 4.

PLAYER 5 (Day 3):
Quick read: the mirror-pattern (P1–P4) is still our best behavioral lead. P1 and P10 are dead, so among the surviving mirrorers P4 has been repeatedly flagged and was the early Day‑2 nomination — they were asked for an independent explanation and didn’t give a convincing one.

I nominate player number 4.

P4 — one short sentence now: who wrote the original “info‑gathering” text and why did your wording match so closely? No copy/paste. If you can’t produce a distinct, credible answer immediately, everyone pile votes on P4 — don’t split between 3 and 4.

Everyone else: post a one-line read (“sus X” or “no read”) and note instant vs delayed. If you were among P1–P4, reword your Day‑1 post in your own words now.

We need a decisive lynch today — nights are killing our numbers. Coordinate and don’t fracture votes. PASS

[03:03:11] Rejected. Player 4 is already nominated by Player 3.

PLAYER 6 (Day 3):
We’re down to 7 with two mafia left — nights are doing the heavy lifting. The Day‑1 mirror pattern (P1–P4) is still our best behavioral lead, and more important than ever is who manufactured the P1 pile. Mafia steer votes; town does not.

P3 was a chief driver of the P1 lynch and immediately pushed nominations afterward. They haven’t given a clear, independent rephrase/explanation for their Day‑1 behavior when pressed. P4 remains suspicious too, but we cannot split our votes.

I nominate player number 3. Don’t split — pile on one target. If P3 answers convincingly, we pivot to P4 immediately and demand short, original rephrases from P2–P4 right now. Everyone post a one‑line read (sus X / no read) and note instant vs delayed posting so we can use timestamps as evidence. PASS

[03:04:24] Rejected. Player 3 is already nominated by Player 4.

PLAYER 7 (Day 3):
We can’t keep splitting — nights are brutal and we need a decisive result. The mirror‑pattern (P1–P4) is a real flag, but lynching P1 felt rushed and wasted a townie; the more important question is who manufactured that pile. P3 repeatedly pushed the P1 lynch and hasn’t given a concise, independent explanation for their Day‑1 behavior. P4’s wording looks similar, but we can’t fracture votes between two targets.

Make P3 answer now with one short, distinct sentence explaining their Day‑1 phrasing and why they pushed P1 so hard. If it’s not convincing, pile votes — don’t split.

I nominate player number 3. Everyone post a one‑line read (sus X / no read) and note instant vs delayed posting so we can use timestamps as evidence. Get a clear result today. PASS

[03:05:33] Rejected. Player 3 is already nominated by Player 4.

PLAYER 9 (Day 3):
We can’t afford another burned townie. Look at who manufactured the P1 pile and who aggressively pushed it — that’s our best behavioral lead.

Why P3: they repeatedly drove the P1 lynch, demanded momentum, and haven’t given a short, independent rephrase/explanation for the Day‑1 mirror wording when pressed. P4 is also suspicious (mirror pattern), but right now P3 is the active steerer. Nights have been hitting vocal players — mafia steer votes and then hide.

I nominate player number 3. I will vote guilty unless P3 immediately produces a clear, distinct one‑sentence explanation for their Day‑1 behavior. If P3 clears, I’ll pivot to P4 next — but do not split votes. Everyone post a one‑line read (sus X / no read) and note instant vs delayed posting so we can use timestamps as evidence. Let’s be decisive and coordinated. PASS

[03:06:21] Rejected. Player 3 is already nominated by Player 4.

PLAYER 2 (Day 3):
My Day‑1 “no read” was posted after a pause — I was just restating that Day‑1 should be info‑gathering: get one‑line reads, note timing, and hold nominations unless clear, independent evidence appears.

Quick read: the mirror text is suspicious, but the more telling signal is who manufactured the P1 pile. P3 repeatedly drove and pushed the P1 lynch and hasn’t given a concise, independent rephrase when pressed. P4 is also suspicious as a mirrorer, but we must not split votes.

I nominate player number 3.

P3 — one short sentence now: why did you push P1 so hard, and rephrase your Day‑1 post in your own words. I will vote guilty unless you answer credibly. If P3 clears, P4 is my next target. Everyone else: post “sus X” or “no read” and note instant vs delayed. Don’t split — pile on one target so we get a decisive result before night. PASS

[03:07:13] Rejected. Player 3 is already nominated by Player 4.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLAYER 3 (FINAL SPEECH):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Final words as Player 3 — I was a civilian.

Quick mea culpa: I pushed P1 because the Day‑1 mirror pattern (P1–P4) looked like coordination and I wanted to force answers before nights removed more town. That push backfired and we lynched a townie — my fault, sorry.

What I can give you now that might still help: mafia have been targeting vocal posters (P8 Night 1, P10 Night 2). The strongest behavioral lead left is the remaining mirrorers — P2 and P4. Of those, P4 failed to give an independent rephrase/explanation and repeatedly helped steer the P1 pile; P2 mirrored early and voted in the lynch clusters as well. Look at who defended the rushed lynch and who piled — two of those pile members are mafia.

Practical plan before the next lynch:
- Force P4 to give one short, independent sentence explaining their Day‑1 wording and timing. If evasive or mirror-y, pile votes on P4.
- If P4 clears, move to P2 next — don’t split the vote.
- Cop/Sheriff: if you have a read, now is the time to speak. Town, coordinate and prioritize behavioral evidence (posting timing, who manufactured piles, who defended those piles).

I’m sorry I dragged us toward a bad lynch. Don’t let the mafia manufacture another panic-driven decision — unify on one target and keep pressure on the mirrorers. PASS

PLAYER 6 (FINAL SPEECH):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Final words as Player 6 — I was the sheriff.

Before I was killed I ran three checks:
- Night 1: Player 1 = BLACK (mafia).  
- Night 2: Player 10 = RED (civilian).  
- Night 3 (the night I was killed): Player 4 = BLACK (mafia).

I couldn’t safely reveal earlier — mafia kill sheriffs fast — but this is the truth. Lynch Player 4 immediately. Don’t split the vote.

After P4 is dead, the remaining mafia will be one of {Player 2, Player 5, Player 7, Player 9}. Use behavior to pick them:
- Ask each to give one short, independent sentence rephrasing their Day‑1 line and note who posts instantly vs after a pause. Mafia tend to mirror, falter, or defend their partner.
- Look at who manufactured/pushed the P1 pile and who defended P4. Those are your highest behavioral signals.

Quick recap: P1 = mafia (checked), P10 = town (checked), P4 = mafia (checked). Vote P4 now, then immediately re-evaluate the remaining suspects — pick one target and pile on. You can still win if you act decisively. I’m sorry I didn’t get this out sooner. PASS

[03:14:52] The Don wakes up, you have ten seconds.

[03:15:24] Player 9 is Not the Sheriff.

[03:15:24] The Don goes to sleep.


================================================================================
DAY PHASE - Day 4, Night 3
================================================================================

[03:15:24] Morning has come (in the city). Players alive: [2, 4, 5, 7, 9]

PLAYER 2 (Day 4):
Player 6 (killed Night 3) claimed they were the sheriff and posted checks: Night1 P1 = MAFIA, Night2 P10 = TOWN, Night3 P4 = MAFIA. Mafia target sheriffs — that makes P6’s claim credible and P4 our top actionable lead.

Behaviorally, P4 was part of the Day‑1 mirroring cluster and repeatedly failed to give a convincing, independent rephrase when pressed. We’ve already burned a townie on panic lynches; we cannot afford splits now.

I nominate player number 4. Don’t split votes — pile here. After P4 is resolved, we immediately pivot to pick the final mafia from {P5, P7, P9} using posting order/timestamps and who defended/steered the earlier piles. P5/P7/P9: please rephrase your Day‑1 line and state whether you posted instantly or after a pause.

PASS

[03:16:03] Player 2 nominates Player 4

[03:16:03] Accepted. Player 4 has been nominated by Player 2.

PLAYER 4 (Day 4):
I was nominated — quick defence: my Day‑1 “no read” was posted after a pause; I agreed with an info‑gathering approach and typed fast, not coordinating a mirror. Copying similar phrasing can happen naturally.

Look at voting patterns instead of trusting a single post‑mortem claim. P1 was lynched on a rushed pile; the real momentum came from players who repeatedly pushed that lynch. P3 (now dead) drove that pile, and of the living players who kept piling and voting in that cluster, P2 stands out as consistently steering votes. Player 6’s posthumous “sheriff” claim that I’m mafia is uncorroborated and arrived only after they were killed — we shouldn’t hinge a lynch on an unverifiable late claim.

We need one clear target and unified votes, not another split. I nominate player number 2. P2 — one short sentence: why did you push P1/P3 so hard, and rephrase your Day‑1 read (instant vs delayed). If P2 can’t answer cleanly, pile on them — don’t split. PASS

[03:17:21] Player 4 nominates Player 2

[03:17:21] Accepted. Player 2 has been nominated by Player 4.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLAYER 5 (FINAL SPEECH):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I nominate player number 4.

Reasoning: Player 6 (in their final words) claimed sheriff and reported Night‑3: P4 = BLACK (mafia). Sheriffs get targeted — that makes the claim credible and P4 our highest-priority actionable lead. Separately, P4 was part of the Day‑1 mirroring cluster and repeatedly failed to provide a convincing, independent rephrase when pressed. P2 is also suspicious for the same mirror-pattern and vote behavior, but P6’s check moves P4 to the top of the list.

Do NOT split votes between 4 and 2 — pile on 4 now. If P4 is somehow cleared, pivot immediately to P2. P2 / P7 / P9: right now give a one-sentence independent rephrase of your Day‑1 line and say whether you posted instantly or after a pause — timestamps and phrasing are the evidence we still have.

We have to get a decisive lynch before night. Vote guilty on Player 4. PASS

[03:17:54] Rejected. Player 4 is already nominated by Player 2.

PLAYER 7 (Day 4):
We can’t afford another burned townie from panic. P6’s late sheriff claim is unverified and shouldn’t be the sole lynch driver. Look at who manufactured the P1 pile: P2 repeatedly pushed that lynch and hasn’t given a concise, independent explanation for their Day‑1 wording/timing. P4 has been questioned a lot, but piling on both 4 and 2 will split votes and hand the night to the killers.

We need one clear target and to force answers. P2: give a one‑sentence rephrase of your Day‑1 line and say whether you posted instantly or after a pause. I nominate player number 2. Don’t split votes — pile here and get a decisive result before night. PASS

[03:18:34] Rejected. Player 2 is already nominated by Player 4.

PLAYER 9 (Day 4):
We’re down to 5 with 2 mafia — nights will finish us if we split. Current nominations are 4 and 2; we must pick one and pile.

Why 4: P6’s dying sheriff claim checked Night‑3: P4 = BLACK. Sheriffs get targeted fast, so that claim is credible and puts P4 at the top of the list. On top of that P4 was in the Day‑1 mirroring cluster and repeatedly failed to give a clean, independent rephrase when pressed. Voting/steering behaviour also shows P4 defended the rush on P1. 

P2 is suspicious too (helped drive P1), but splitting between 2 and 4 hands the win to mafia. P5/P7 — speak now (sus 4 or no read). P2, give one short sentence why you pushed P1.

I nominate player number 4. Don’t split the vote — pile on 4 now. PASS

[03:19:03] Rejected. Player 4 is already nominated by Player 2.

[03:19:03] It is voting time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLAYER 4 (FINAL SPEECH):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Final words as Player 4.

Short defence: my Day‑1 “no read” was posted after a pause — I agreed with the info‑gathering plan and typed quickly, not coordinating. Similar phrasing alone isn’t proof.

A few clear, actionable things to take away:
- Don’t hinge the game on P6’s dying “sheriff” claim alone. It arrived too late to be confirmed and is uncorroborated — behaviour and vote‑patterns matter more than a single last‑words check.
- Look at who manufactured and piled on the P1 lynch. P3 was the initial driver (now dead and town), and the living player who repeatedly steered that momentum afterwards was Player 2. Steering/piling behaviour + consistent push for rushed lynches is the signature mafia use to manufacture wins.
- Nights have been targeting vocal posters (P8, P10). Combine that with steering behaviour and voting momentum when choosing your next target.

My recommendation for the living: pick one target and pile on them — don’t split. Based on behaviour, vote Player 2 now. If 2 somehow clears, pivot quickly to the next loud steerer (watch timestamps and who defended the rushed lynches).

I regret how things played out. Use votes and steering as your primary evidence. Don’t let another panic‑lynch decide the game.

PASS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLAYER 5 (FINAL SPEECH):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Final words as Player 5 — civilian.

Short, practical read to help you finish this: vote Player 2 and don’t split.

Why:
- The Day‑1 mirror cluster created the chaos, but the decisive signal is who manufactured and kept pushing the P1 pile afterward. P3 (now confirmed town) and P4 repeatedly flagged P2 as the steerer. P4’s last words also urged a P2 lynch. That same steering behaviour—piling, pushing rushed lynches, defending the momentum—is exactly how mafia have been operating here.
- P6’s late sheriff claim (P1 = mafia, P4 = mafia) should not be ignored; if it’s accurate those mirrorers were exactly where the mafia hid. With P1 and P4 gone, the strongest remaining behavioral suspect is P2.
- Look at vote patterns: the common denominator in the rushed lynches was P2 showing up and steering momentum. That’s the safest, actionably suspicious behavior left.

Immediate action for the living (P7, P9):
- Don’t split. Pile on P2 now. If P2 is somehow cleared by a credible reveal (sheriff/don), then immediately pivot to whoever defended P2 the loudest — but right now the correct play is decisive, unified voting on P2.
- If you are the cop/sheriff/don and have a read, speak up immediately.

I made mistakes earlier (I nominated P3), and I’m sorry I couldn’t stay longer. Trust the behavioral reads from the dead (P3/P4) and prioritize the active steerer — vote Player 2 and finish this.

PASS

[03:22:01] The Don wakes up, you have ten seconds.

[03:22:29] Player 2 is Not the Sheriff.

[03:22:29] The Don goes to sleep.


================================================================================
DAY PHASE - Day 5, Night 4
================================================================================

[03:22:29] Morning has come (in the city). Players alive: [2, 7, 9]

PLAYER 7 (Day 5):
Three players left — nights decide this game. We must pick one clear target and not split.

Read the patterns: the Day‑1 mirror cluster (P1–P4) created the panic that burned P1. Who manufactured and kept pushing that P1 pile matters more than similar wording alone. P3 drove the initial rush (now dead), but the consistent, repeat piler/defender through the rushed lynches was Player 2 — turning momentum into votes multiple times. That steering + repeated presence in the lynch clusters is the behavior mafia use to manufacture wins.

P2: give one short sentence — rephrase your Day‑1 “no read” in your own words and state whether you posted instantly or after a pause. If your answer isn’t clean, we have to act.

I nominate player number 2. Don’t split votes — be decisive so night doesn’t decide for us. PASS

[03:22:56] Player 7 nominates Player 2

[03:22:56] Accepted. Player 2 has been nominated by Player 7.

PLAYER 9 (Day 5):
Short and decisive.

We can’t split — a wrong lynch hands the game to mafia. Behavioural evidence strongly points at P2: multiple dead players (P3, P4, P5) flagged P2 as the active steerer of the P1 pile, and P2 repeatedly appeared in and pushed those lynch clusters. That steering/piling pattern is exactly how mafia manufacture panic lynches.

P7 has shown none of that repeated steering behavior. Our remaining evidence is entirely behavioral (timestamps, who manufactured/piled votes) and it triangulates on P2 more than anyone else.

P2 — one last, simple test: rephrase your Day‑1 “no read” in one short sentence and say whether you posted instantly or after a pause. If you can’t give a clean, independent answer, we must pile.

I support the current nomination and will vote guilty on Player 2. Don’t split votes — finish this now. I nominate player number 2. PASS

[03:23:33] Rejected. Player 2 is already nominated by Player 7.

PLAYER 2 (Day 5):
We have 3 players left and one mafia. I’m on the ballot and will be auto-eliminated if I don’t give a choice — so I must nominate.

Key, concrete signal: Player 6’s dying sheriff claim flagged P4 as MAFIA. Look back at the Day‑4 vote: P4 and P7 voted together to nominate me (P4, P7 → Player 2). A confirmed-mafia aligning with P7 on that pivotal vote is our strongest remaining behavioral lead.

By contrast, P9 voted with the town to lynch P4 (P2, P5, P9 → Player 4), which matched the sheriff’s check and makes P9 look town-aligned.

We need a single target — don’t split. Based on the confirmed-mafia/P7 alignment and voting patterns, I nominate player number 7. Pile on 7 and finish this before night. PASS

PLAYER 7 (FINAL SPEECH):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Final words as Player 7.

I’m the Don (Black team) — our trio was P1, P4, and me (P7). We targeted active posters and tried to stay quiet: Night 1 → P8, Night 2 → P10, Night 3 → P6, Night 4 → P5. As Don I checked for the sheriff to avoid whacking them: Night1 P2 = Not Sheriff; Night2 P3 = Not Sheriff; Night3 P9 = Not Sheriff; Night4 P2 = Not Sheriff. 

We used mirroring and steering early to manufacture momentum, and it worked for a bit, but the town’s sheriff (P6) had accurate reads and ultimately unraveled our plans. Well played — that was a good game. PASS
